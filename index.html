      <p>Hello! I'm Sydney, and I'm a high school student from upstate New York with an affinity for learning, creating, and exploring. My pronouns are she/her.</p>
      <p>I'm a classically trained violist and pianist, as well as an amateur artist and designer. I spend my free time running on my school's track and field team, playing video games, and getting outside as much as I can! I have a cat and a dog, and often foster kittens for a rescue group. I hope to major in physics or computer science. </p>
      <p>On this site, you can find my portfolio of various past work in areas of both STEM and the arts, as well as  resources I've used to inspire and create my work. I hope you enjoy!</p>
